# web-coding-challenge
Work on the coding challenge - challenge proposed by the IT Company United Remote

firstable, i wanna thank you for this awesome challenge, and for yor trust, it was a great experience for me that leads to practice and to think about it for the optimized solution

For the thechnical spec: i chose the PHP web programming langage because i did the most of projects and i solve some problems with it.
In the first, it was expacting to work with Symfony framework , but it will take some time and also it needs some configuration to review my project

About the functional spec, i tried to respect all of them with optimized tricks. I tried to test all fuctions 

- As a User, I can sign up using my email & password
- As a User, I can sign in using my email & password
- As a User, I can display the list of shops sorted by distance
- As a User, I can like a shop, so it can be added to my preferred shops
  --->Acceptance criteria: liked shops shouldn’t be displayed on the main page

Also bonus points:

[BONUS] As a User, I can dislike a shop, so it won’t be displayed within “Nearby Shops” list during the next 2 hours
[BONUS] As a User, I can display the list of preferred shops
[BONUS] As a User, I can remove a shop from my preferred shops list

There is a directory that contains the database


Best regard thank you
