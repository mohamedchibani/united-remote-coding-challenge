# web-coding-challenge
Work on the coding challenge - challenge proposed by the IT Company United Remote

firstable, i wanna thank you for this awesome challenge, and for yor trust, it was a great experience for me that leads to practice and to think about it for the optimized solution

For the thechnical spec: i chose the PHP web programming langage because i did the most of projects and i solve some problems with it.
In the first, it was expacting to work with Symfony framework , but it will take some time and also it needs some configuration to review my project

About the functional spec, i tried to respect all of them with optimized tricks. I tried to test all fuctions 

- As a User, I can sign up using my email & password
- As a User, I can sign in using my email & password
- As a User, I can display the list of shops sorted by distance
- As a User, I can like a shop, so it can be added to my preferred shops
  --->Acceptance criteria: liked shops shouldn’t be displayed on the main page

Also bonus point (those items are optional):

[BONUS] As a User, I can dislike a shop, so it won’t be displayed within “Nearby Shops” list during the next 2 hours
[BONUS] As a User, I can display the list of preferred shops
[BONUS] As a User, I can remove a shop from my preferred shops list

There is a directory that contains the database


1 PROBLEME, if you well noticed, i found a probleme for a seconde user account, only in the main page ,
liked shops for the first user account didn't displayed also the disliked  shop, didn't displayed within “Nearby Shops” list during the next 2 hours.
Even if i tried to use the user_id to hide only his shops 

Please, for any suggestions to fix this point, contact me the solution :)

Best regard thank you
